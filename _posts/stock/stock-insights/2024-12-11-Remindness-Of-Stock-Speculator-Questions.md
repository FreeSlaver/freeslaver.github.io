场景问题一：
Bot Steel在90美元，一般桶店收取1/8的手续费，也就是成本价格在90-1/8，缴纳1个点的保证金，也就是价格到89，就爆仓了，
也就是向下最多回撤3/8，也就是3/8的止损。这尼玛多少倍杠杆？？90多倍。
然后最后一家桶店，成交价会设定在91-1/8，然后要缴纳3个点的保证金，但是止损依然是3/8，就是即使价格从90涨到91-1/8，依然是亏钱的。
如果是你，你怎么来操作？？

就目前A股这个波动率，这根本没法做，就比如90的股票b，向下波动一个点到89，就爆仓了，一般止损是10个点，也就是81。
现在的止损是1.1%。怎么做？拿奋达科技，明牌走势，在哪里买入？？
1.20日，30日均线支撑？
2.确定性下跌？
3.破而后立不破不立，在阻挡前买入？
都他妈的不行，那这样把，反问一个问题：在A股你能将止损设置到最少，最小幅度是多少？百分之几？
这个问题没意义，海能达这样的龙头妖股，随便波动下就是6个点以上，但是问题是：杰西利物莫是怎么做到在桶店赌博，赌价格波动的？


The price behaved as I thought it would. It promptly went
down a couple of points and paused a little to get its breath before taking another dip.

场景问题二：
I made up my mind to be wise and play carefully,
conservatively. Everybody knew that the way to do that was to 
**take profits and buy back your stocks on reactions**. 
And that is precisely what I did, or rather what I tried to do; for
I often took profits and waited for a reaction that never came. And I saw my stock go
kiting up ten points more and I sitting there with my four-point profit safe in my
conservative pocket. They say you never grow poor taking profits. No, you don't. But
neither do you grow rich taking a four-point profit in a bull market.

Where I should have made twenty thousand dollars I made two thousand. That was what
my conservatism did for me.

Disregarding the big swing and trying to jump in and out was fatal to me. Nobody can
catch all the fluctuations.In a bull market your game is to buy and hold until you believe
that the bull market is near its end.


My good friend Union Pacific, I noticed, looked like going up. The
price was high, but the stock acted as if it were being accumulated. I watched it a couple
of days without trading in it, and the more I watched it the more convinced I became that
it was being bought on balance by somebody who was no piker, somebody who not only
had a big bank roll but knew what was what. Very clever accumulation, I thought


That Saratoga experience was my last haphazard, hit-or-miss operation. From
then on I began to think of basic conditions instead of individual stocks. I promoted
myself to a higher grade in the hard school of speculation. It was a long and difficult
step to take.

Now, the point is not so much to buy as cheap as possible or go short at top prices, but to buy or
sell at the right time.


I wait and see. I figure that at some stage of the rise there is going to be a reaction. I want to see how the
market takes care of itself after that reaction.

To learn the time, he has to watch and test. It is no trick to tell
when the market can take what you give it.

Wait and watch. That is where your tape reading conies in to enable you to decide
as to the proper time for beginning.Much depends upon beginning at exactly the right
time. It took me years to realize the importance of this. It also cost me some hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

Old man Partridge's insistence on the vital
importance of being continuously bullish in a bull market doubtless made tny mind
dwell on the need above all other things of determining the kind of market a man is
trading in.

Obviously the thing to do was to be bullish in a bull market and bearish in a bear market.
Sounds silly, doesn't it? But I had to grasp that general principle firmly before I saw that
to put it into practice really meant to anticipate probabilities


The moment I ceased to be satisfied with merely studying the tape I ceased to concern
myself exclusively with the daily fluctuations in specific stocks, and when that happened
I simply had to study the game from a different angle. I worked back from the quotation
to first principles; from price fluctuations to basic conditions.


It was not a vital matter for them to marshal
their facts and draw their conclusions from them, but it was for me. Also there was a
vast difference in our appraisal of the element of time.

If you begin right you will not see your profitable position seriously menaced; 
and then you will find no trouble in sitting tight.

but the reason I cleaned up was that I figured that the decline had
discounted the immediate future.

Timid people don't like to buy a stock at a new high record. But I had
the history of such movements to guide me.I was bearish, remember, but I was also a tape-reading trader. I knew Anaconda, if it
went the way I figured, would move very quickly. Whatever moves fast always appeals
to me.

Bearish on the entire market and bullish
on that one stock!
The way Anaconda had gone up it wouldn't have
been anything unusual for it to break twenty points
I made up my mind that if
Anaconda went back to 301 I must" consider the whole thing a fake movement. On a
legitimate advance the price should have gone to 310 without stopping.


The way to make money is to make it. 
The way to make big money is to be right at exactly the right time.
